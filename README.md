## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project I refactored the source code given on index.html and style.css. I replaced various elements with semantic html elements for better use accessibility as well as getting everything up to current standards. In style.css I grouped certain declarations and selectors together to limit redundancies.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Kindly scroll through the website and enjoy semantic html and concise css.
